Questions this project should answer:

- By position:
	- What’s the DM level of the position?
	- Has that DM level ever changed?
- By person:
	- What DM levels has that person held?
	- How have they progressed through the DM levels?

To do that, this project needs:

- Who held deputy positions, when (OICs, optionally also “Change in the ranks” announcements)
	- [Raw OIC data, all OICs](https://github.com/lchski/oic-data)
	- [Script to extract deputy appointments](https://github.com/lchski/oic-analysis/blob/main/analysis/deputy-appointments.R)
	- [TODO: link to folder of extracted OICs in this repo]
- What the pay ranges for those deputy positions was (OICs)
	- [Raw OIC data, all OICs](https://github.com/lchski/oic-data)
	- [Script to extract deputy appointments](https://github.com/lchski/oic-analysis/blob/main/analysis/deputy-appointments.R)
	- [TODO: link to folder of extracted OICs in this repo]
- What the pay ranges correspond to in deputy levels (PCO “[Salary ranges and maximum pay ranges for Governor in Council appointees](https://www.canada.ca/en/privy-council/programs/appointments/governor-council-appointments/compensation-terms-conditions-employment/salary-ranges-performance-pay.html)”)
	- [TODO: convert to CSV, store in repo; find years before 2014-15, if possible, though lower priority]
